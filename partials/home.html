            Before taking Studio Lab I in Algonquin College’s Interactive Media Management program, my photography
            skills were limited to smartphone snaps. This course changed everything—teaching me composition, lighting,
            and camera settings while giving me hands-on experience in a professional studio.
        </p>
        <p>
            From portrait setups to product shots, I learned how lighting and angles shape an image. Now, I approach
            photography with confidence, whether for social media, websites, or creative projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Studio Lab I didn’t just teach me photography—it taught me to see creatively. For anyone in a media program,
            I’d say: embrace the studio. The skills you gain will elevate your work in ways you never expected.

            Digital vs. Traditional Drawing: Key Differences Explained
        </h4>

            Digital and traditional drawing offer artists different creative experiences, each with its own strengths.
            Traditional drawing uses physical tools like pencils, pens, and paper, providing a hands-on, tactile process
            that many artists love. The natural textures and organic feel of traditional media can be hard to replicate
            digitally. However, mistakes are harder to fix, and materials can add up in cost over time

        </p>
        <p>
            Digital drawing, on the other hand, relies on software and hardware like tablets and styluses, providing
            endless flexibility. Layers, undo buttons, and customizable brushes make experimentation effortless. Artists
            can easily adjust colors, resize elements, or even animate their work—all within the same file. Yet, some
            argue that digital tools lack the organic feel of traditional media, and the learning curve for software can
            be steep for beginners.
        </p>
        <p>
            One key difference is workflow efficiency. Digital art allows for quick edits, file sharing, and
            professional-grade results without scanning or photographing physical pieces. Traditional art, however,
            often requires more setup, cleanup, and preservation efforts. For illustrators working on tight deadlines,
            digital tools can be a game-changer, while fine artists may prefer the authenticity of handcrafted pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite their differences, both mediums have their place in the art world. Many artists blend the
            two—sketching traditionally before refining digitally or using textured brushes to mimic real media. The
            choice ultimately depends on personal preference, project needs, and desired artistic expression. Whether
            you love the feel of paper or the convenience of a stylus, both methods offer endless creative
            possibilities.

            The Power of Storyboarding in Motion Graphics and Video Composition
        </h4>
        <figure>

        <p>
            Storyboarding is a crucial step in motion graphics and video production, acting as a visual roadmap for the
            entire project. It helps artists and filmmakers plan scenes, camera angles, and transitions before investing
            time in animation or filming. By sketching out key frames, creators can spot potential issues early and
            refine their ideas efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
            In motion graphics, storyboarding ensures smooth animation flow and timing. Designers can map out how
            elements move, appear, or disappear, syncing them perfectly with voiceovers or music. This pre-visualization
            saves hours of trial-and-error work later, making the production process faster and more organized.
        </p>

        <p>
            For video composition, storyboards guide shot selection and framing, improving visual storytelling. They
            help directors and cinematographers decide on close-ups, wide shots, or camera movements to convey emotion
            or information effectively. A well-planned storyboard also maintains consistency across scenes, avoiding
            costly reshoots.

        </p>

        <p>
            While traditional hand-drawn storyboards are still useful, digital tools like Procreate or Adobe Illustrator
            offer flexibility and easy edits. Some creators even use animatics—rough animated storyboards—to test timing
            and pacing with temporary audio, ensuring the final product meets their vision.

        </p>

        <p>
            Whether for motion graphics or live-action videos, storyboarding is a game-changer. It transforms abstract
            ideas into structured plans, boosting creativity while saving time and resources. No matter the scale of
            your project, a solid storyboard is the first step to a polished, professional result.
